# slippi-wiiconf
Simple Wii app - used to prepare a console for use with 
[the Project Slippi fork of Nintendont](https://github.com/project-slippi/Nintendont).
Based _very heavily_ on [the template for libwiigui applications](https://github.com/dborth/libwiigui).

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** You can use this application to change the Wii's network 
settings. Like with any other homebrew apps that modify system configuration, 
there is probably some amount of risk involved in doing this.
Don't use this application if you don't know what you're doing, or if you
aren't willing to accept that risk.
